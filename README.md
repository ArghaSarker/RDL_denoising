## üóø Introduction

Fluorescence microscopy is a powerful imaging technique that enables visualization
of biological specimens at
cellular and subcellular level with a resolution limit of 200-300 nm. The development of structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has further enhanced resolution by exploiting the interference of light patterns to achieve SIM reconstructions with two times resolution. However, imaging biological specimens under microscopy faces fundamental challenges, such as imaging speed, light exposure, and spatial resolution.


Achieving high‚Äêquality SIM reconstructions critically depends on acquiring images with a high signal‚Äêto‚Äênoise ratio (SNR). However, several competing factors make this goal difficult to attain in practice. Rapid acquisition rates naturally decrease the average number of photons captured per frame, leading to a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Increasing excitation intensity to compensate for the risk of concealing information introduces the pitfalls of damaging the samples. Moreover, the intrinsic structural complexity of many biological specimens further degrades SIM performance under low‚ÄêSNR conditions, as fine features become obscured by noise.

In this work, we present an image denoising and SIM reconstruction approach based on our [Projection Upsampling Network (PU-Net)](https://github.com/ArghaSarker/projection_upsampling_network), which aims to replace the SIM reconstruction module, DFCAN, in the original RDL-SIM approach, as proposed by [Qiao et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01471-3).
